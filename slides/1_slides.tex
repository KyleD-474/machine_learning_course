\section{Artificial intelligence/machine learning/deep learning}

\begin{frame}{DL/ML/AI}
\begin{itemize}
\item You can think of deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence as a set of Russian dolls nested within each other. 
\item Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and machine learning is a subset of AI, which is an umbrella term for any computer program that does something smart. \item In other words, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning, and so forth.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Artificial intelligence}
\begin{itemize}
\item John McCarthy, one of the founders of artificial intelligence, defined it as ``the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.''

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)}

\item Here are a few other definitions of artificial intelligence:

\item A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers.

\item The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.

\item A computer system able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Symbolic AI/GOFAI}
\begin{itemize}
\item Symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level "symbolic" (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search.

\item Symbolic artificial intelligence is often called GOFAI (``Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence'').

\item The programming language Prolog is an example of symbolic artificial intelligence \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Symbolic AI/GOFAI}
Roughly speaking, symbolic AI operates like this:
\begin{verbatim}
                    
Input ------->  +---------+
                |         |-------> Output
Rules ------->  +---------+

\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Machine learning}
\begin{itemize}
\item In 1959, Arthur Samuel, coined the machine learning and defined it as a ``field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.''

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel}

\item That is, machine-learning programs have not been explicitly entered into a computer, like the if-then statements above. 

\item Machine-learning programs, in a sense, adjust themselves in response to the data theyâ€™re exposed to (like a child that is born knowing nothing adjusts its understanding of the world in response to experience).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Machine learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Machine learning is dynamic and does not require human intervention to make certain changes. 

\item That makes it less brittle, and less reliant on human experts.

\item Tom Mitchell provided a widely quoated, more formal definition of the algorithms studies in the machine learning field:

\medskip
\begin{quote}
A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$ if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Machine learning}
\begin{itemize}
\item One aspect that separates machine learning from symbolic AI is its ability to modify itself when exposed to more data.

\item Instead of coding up rules that transform the input to output, a machine learning system comes up with the rules itself.

\begin{verbatim}

Input ------->  +---------+
                |         |-------> Rules
Output ------>  +---------+

\end{verbatim}
\item The learned rules can then be used to predict outputs for new unseen inputs.

\item We will make this more precise, especially in the context of supervised learning.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Combining two AI approaches}
\begin{itemize}
\item One may think that symbolic AI (GOFAI) is somewhat ``boring'', while machine learning (in particular, deep learning) is ``cool.''

\item This is not the case. For instance, the recent research paperstries to combine both approaches:

\medskip
\url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12584.pdf}

\medskip
Here is a short description of the main ideas in MIT  Technology Review:

{\tiny \url{https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613270/two-rival-ai-approaches-combine-to-let-machines-learn-about-the-world-like-a-child/}}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item This concludes the high-level overview of artificial intelligence.

\item Let's look at machine learning in more details.

\section{Machine learning}

\begin{frame}{Common ML Problems}

\begin{itemize}

\item In basic terms, ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions using a data set. 

\item This predictive model can then serve up predictions about previously unseen data. 

\item We use these predictions to take action in a product; for example, the system predicts that a user will like a certain video, so the system recommends that video to the user.

\item Often, people talk about ML as having two paradigms, supervised and unsupervised learning. 

\item However, it is more accurate to describe ML problems as falling along a spectrum of supervision between supervised and unsupervised learning.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Supervised learning}

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model is provided with labeled training data. But what does that mean?

\item For example, suppose you are an amateur botanist determined to differentiate between two species of the Lilliputian plant genus (a completely made-up plant). 

\item The two species look pretty similar. Fortunately, a botanist has put together a data set of Lilliputian plants she found in the wild along with their species name.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Here's a snippet of that data set:

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Leaf Width & Leaf Length & Species \\ \hline
2.7	& 4.9 & small-leaf \\
3.2	& 5.5 & big-leaf \\
2.9	& 5.1 & small-leaf \\
3.4	& 6.8 & big-leaf 
\end{tabular}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}

\item Leaf width and leaf length are the features, while the species is the label. 

\item A real life botanical data set would probably contain far more features (including descriptions of flowers, blooming times, arrangement of leaves) but still have only one label. 

\item Features are measurements or descriptions; the label is essentially the ``answer.'' 

\item For example, the goal of the data set is to help other botanists answer the question, ``Which species is this plant?''

\item This data set consists of only four examples. A real life data set would likely contain vastly more examples.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose we graph the leaf width and leaf length and then color-code the species.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Graph1.png}

\end{frame}

%%

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item In supervised machine learning, you feed the features and their corresponding labels into an algorithm in a process called training. 

\item During training, the algorithm gradually determines the relationship between features and their corresponding labels. This relationship is called the model. 

\item Often times in machine learning, the model is very complex. 

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}

\item However, suppose that this model can be represented as a line that separates big-leaf from small-leaf:

\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Graph2.png}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now that a model exists, you can use that model to classify new plants that you find in the jungle. For example:
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Graph3.png}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item To tie it all together, supervised machine learning finds patterns between data and labels that can be expressed mathematically as functions. 

\item Given an input feature, you are telling the system what the expected output label is, thus you are supervising the training. The ML system will learn patterns on this labeled data. 

\item In the future, the ML system will use these patterns to make predictions on data that it did not see during training.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}

\item A real-world example of supervised learning is a study from Stanford University that used a model to detect skin cancer in images. 

\medskip
\url{https://news.stanford.edu/2017/01/25/artificial-intelligence-used-identify-skin-cancer/}

\item In this case, the training set contained images of skin labeled by dermatologists as having one of several diseases. 

\item The ML system found signals that indicate each disease from its training set, and used those signals to make predictions on new, unlabeled images.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%

\subsection{Unsupervised learning}

\begin{frame}{Unsupervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}

\item In unsupervised learning, the goal is to identify meaningful patterns in the data. 

\item To accomplish this, the machine must learn from an unlabeled data set. 

\item In other words, the model has no hints how to categorize each piece of data and must infer its own rules for doing so.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Unsupervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item All the examples are the same shape because we don't have labels to differentiate between examples of one type or another here:
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Graph4.png}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Unsupervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fitting a line to unlabeled points isn't helpful. We still end up with examples of the same shape on both sides of the line. 
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Graph5.png}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Unsupervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Here, we have two clusters. What do these clusters represent? It can be difficult to say. Sometimes the model finds patterns in the data that you don't want it to learn, such as stereotypes or bias.

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Graph6.png}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Unsupervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item However, when new data arrives, we can categorize it pretty easily, assuming it fits into a known cluster. 

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Graph7.png}

\end{frame}

%%%

\begin{frame}{Unsupervised Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item But what if your photo clustering model has never seen a pangolin before? 

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin}

\item Will the system cluster the new photo with armadillos or maybe hedgehogs? 

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo}

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%

\subsection{Reinforcement learning}

\begin{frame}{Reinforcement Learning}

\begin{itemize}
\item An additional branch of machine learning is reinforcement learning (RL). Reinforcement learning differs from other types of machine learning. 

\item In RL you don't collect examples with labels. Imagine you want to teach a machine to play a very basic video game and never lose. You set up the model (often called an agent in RL) with the game, and you tell the model not to get a ``game over'' screen. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reinforcement Learning}

\begin{itemize}

\item At time step $t$, the agent is in state $s_t$, takes action $a_t$, receives reward $r_t$, and transitions into state $s_{t+1}$.

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/rl_diagram_transparent_bg.png}

\item The state $S_t$ describes the agent's knowledge of the world. For instance, the visual input from a camera and the positions of the joints of a robot.

\item The agent has to learn which actions to take so as to maximize the total reward.  For instance, a robot has to learn how to grasp and manipulate an object as fast as possible.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reinforcement Learning}

Look at the videos at \url{https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl\_intro.html}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reinforcement Learning}

\begin{itemize} 
\item You also need to provide a way for the agent to interact with the game to produce data, which means either building a physical agent that can interact with the real world or a virtual agent and a virtual world, either of which is a big challenge. 

\item Reinforcement learning is an active field of ML research, but in this course we'll not cover it.
