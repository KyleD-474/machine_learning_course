## Homework 5

*Problem 1*

Summarize and describe the different concepts/methods/algorithms that you have learned in this course.

Use a Colab notebook. Make sure that you organize the material logically by using sections/subsections. Also, use code cell to include code snippets.

I suggest that you group everything into five categories:

- General concepts (for instance, what is artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning)

- Building a model (for instance, here you can talk about the structure of a convent, what it components are etc.)

- Comping a model (for instance, you can talk here about optimizers, learning rate etc.)

- Training a model (for instance, you can talk about overfitting/underfitting)

- Finetuning  a pretrained model (describe how you proceed)
