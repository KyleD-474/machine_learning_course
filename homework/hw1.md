**Homework 1**

**Problem 1**

What does an average MNIST digit look like? For each i=0,1,...,9, compute the average of digit i and display it.

**Problem 2**

Come up with handcrafted features for the MNIST digit classificiation problem and use them in a linear model with softmax output. 
The features could be: width and height of the digit, number of white regions (a typical 8 has three, a typical 6 has two components, and 2 has 1), average intensity, etc.
