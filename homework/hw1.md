**Homework 1**

**Problem 1**

Find three simple functions from $R^2$ to R and suitable points that are:

(i) a local minimum
(ii) a local maximum
(iii) neither a minimum nor maximum, but the gradient is zero at this point.

Plot these functions using 3D plots as in the notebooks for creating density and contour plots and three dimensional plots. Indicate clearly the points.

Extra work: The gradient is a vector so you cannot use cannot use density, contour, or 3d plots as above to visualize it.  However, you can use the python quiver package to visualize a so-called vector field. Draw the gradients for your functions above.  

Extra work: Extend [the notebook for experimenting with different learning rate](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eECClMU1r-Y9hzPnRw89__jC3nw3C-zD) to functions from R^2 to R.

There is a [simple demo](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/quiver_simple_demo.html#sphx-glr-gallery-images-contours-and-fields-quiver-simple-demo-py) showing how to use quiver.

**Problem 2** 

What does an average MNIST digit look like? For each i=0,1,...,9, compute the average of digit i and display it.

Look  under [Keras examples in the README file](https://github.com/schneider128k/machine_learning_course/blob/master/README.md). There is a notebook showing how to load the MNIST data set etc.
